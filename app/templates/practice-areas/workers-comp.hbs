                            A workplace injury occurs suddenly and without warning, creating disruption and uncertainty in your life and the life of your family. These incidents are often accompanied by extensive medical bills and time missed away from work. Consider what would happen if:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>You were a construction worker or roofer and fell from a height, suffering serious brain, neck, or spine injuries;</li>
                            <li>A power tool accident severed one of your hands or feet, leaving you not only disfigured but unable to return to your previous employment;</li>
                            <li>You lose your life because of another person’s carelessness, and your family is left with the bills and expenses from your funeral and burial.</li>

                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            Florida (like all other states) has enacted workers’ compensation laws to help workers and their families navigate through the difficult times following a workplace accident.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Having an attorney represent and assist you along the way can prevent delays and denials that keep you from getting compensation for your injuries.

                            <h3>Workers’ Compensation Claims in Florida</h3>
                            <div id="subHeaderDivider">

                        <p>
                            A Florida workers’ compensation claim is filed when you are either injured or become ill while on the job. Workers’ compensation is an exclusive remedy, meaning that in exchange for being able to receive benefits from your employer’s insurer regardless of who is at fault for your injury, you are unable to bring a separate lawsuit against your employer. (Note, though, that you can bring a separate personal injury lawsuit against a third party that was responsible in whole or in part for your injuries.)
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            At first, it may sound simple to obtain benefits after a workplace injury. However, there are many opportunities for your employer and your employer’s insurer to attempt to limit or deny our claim for benefits.For instance:
                        </p>



                        <ul>
                            <li>Your employer may try to claim the injury occurred at a time you were not engaged in the performance of your duties.</li>
                            <li>Your employer’s insurer may try to claim that your injuries are not as severe as you claim them to be.</li>
                            <li>The insurer may claim that your injuries are due to a preexisting condition that is not connected with any workplace activity.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            A knowledgeable and experienced Florida workers’ compensation advocate can help you defeat these challenges to your claim.

                            <div id="subHeaderDivider">

                        <p>
                            The moments immediately following a workplace injury or illness are critical. Although you may be frightened and unsure as to what to do, it is important to remain calm. Florida requires injured or ill workers to take certain steps within a certain period of time. Failing to do so can prevent you from later filing a workers’ compensation claim.
                        </p>

                        <p>In particular, you should:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Notify your supervisor or employer right away of your injury. Your employer must be made aware that you have been injured or become ill at work, so make every effort to tell your employer as soon as you become aware of the injury or illness.</li>
                            <li>Obtain permission to see a doctor. Your employer’s workers’ compensation insurer must indicate the doctor they wish for you to see – you cannot simply go to your own physician for initial diagnosis and treatment. If you are in serious medical trouble, you may be able to go to the nearest emergency room and inform your employer of this as soon as possible.</li>
                            <li>Formally notify your employer of your injury within 30 days.</li>
                            <li>File your workers’ compensation claim.</li>
                            <li>Throughout the process, be sure to give your employer and treating doctor details about your injuries and how the incident occurred. It is also a good idea to get copies of all the documents and records you can pertaining to your incident and injuries.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            You should avoid putting off notifying your employer or seeking medical treatment, as this can make it more difficult for you to later show that your injuries are truly work-related.
