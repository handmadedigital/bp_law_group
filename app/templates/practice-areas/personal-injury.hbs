                        <p>
                            A personal injury can take many forms and range from minor cuts and abrasions to serious
                            injuries requiring surgery and rehabilitative therapy. Some of the more common forms of
                            personal injuries include:
                        </p>


                        <ul class="bold-start">
                            <li><p><span>Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI):</span> which can occur anytime the head suffers a blow or is
                                struck by an object. TBIs are serious injuries needing quick medical intervention to stabilize the
                                person and prevent further injury. Lifelong treatment is also usually required.</p></li>
                            <li><p><span>Neck and spine injuries:</span> can be present in car crashes, falls from heights, and sports-
                                related injuries. These injuries have the potential of leaving the victim permanently disabled.</p></li>
                            <li><p><span>Broken Bones:</span> often heal, but not without rest and medical treatment. A broken bone can
                                easily mean weeks, if not months, of time away from work or performing lighter work. Broken
                                bones can occur when a bone is hit with enough force, when a person trips and falls or slips and
                                falls, or is involved in a car crash.</p></li>
                            <li><p><span>Cuts &amp; Lacerations:</span> from sharp or rough surfaces like glass, metal, or pavement are
                                common in most personal injury cases. Most cuts are superficial and do not require much
                                treatment beyond a simple bandage. However, some cuts can be deep and life-threatening,
                                especially if an artery is involved. In these cases, medical intervention is needed to save the
                                person’s life. Cuts to the face also have the potential to leave permanent scars and
                                disfigurement.</p></li>
                            <li><p><span>Amputation:</span> occurs when a limb or appendage is severed from the body. While most
                                people think of an amputation as a medical procedure done in a hospital, the truth is that an
                                amputation can occur as part of a personal injury incident. A hand or arm that becomes stuck in
                                a machine can be crushed and amputated, just as a finger caught in a closing door can also be
                                severed. Amputations are serious injuries that leave permanent disfigurement and can result in
                                serious disabilities.</p></li>

                        <p>
                            A personal injury lawsuit is filed after you have been injured through another's fault. While it is possible to file these claims by yourself, your odds of being successful
                            increase dramatically when you use the services of an experienced personal injury attorney.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Your lawsuit is successful when you prove the following:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><p>That the defendant – the one who injured you – either intentionally, negligently or through participation in an Inhered dangerous activity causes you a personal injurie.</p></li>
                            <li><p>That the defendant’s acts caused your injuries. This is known as the “causation” element
                                and is frequently litigated in court. You must show that your injuries happened because of the
                                defendant’s actions. In other words, if you would have been injured regardless of whether the
                                defendant acted carelessly, you will not be able to show causation and your claim will fail.</p></li>
                            <li><p>That as result of your personal injury or injuries, you suffered actual damages. You cannot be compensated through a personal
                                injury lawsuit if you did not suffer any financial damages as a result of the defendant’s actions.</p></li>
                        </ul>
